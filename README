This repositry is used to store the useful programs which are written to analyse the VASP results.

-> Tool 1: vtotav5.2.f and AvePOT.py.
    - How to use: Prepapre input file LOCPOT. Prepare how many components in the simulation cell, total length of the simulation cell along specific direction and lattice constant of each component. 
    - vtotav.5.2.f can read LOCPOT from VASP and convert it to VLINE.txt. AvePOT.py can read VLINE.txt and calculate average potential.


-> Tool 2: Mirror.py.
   - How to use: Prepare the input file of POSCAR or CONTCAR. Should modify the vlaue of the mirror plane.
   - Mirro.py can read the structure of without mirror symmetry and output the mirror symmetry structure.


-> Tool 3: AtomDOS.py
   - How to use: Prepare the input file DOSCAR. Should type in how many atoms in the simulation cell.
   - AtomDOS.py read the DOSCAR and output DOS for each atom in file "##.txt", where ## is the number index of the atom.
