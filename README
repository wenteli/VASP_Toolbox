This repositry is used to store the useful programs which are written to analyse the VASP results.

-> Tool 1: vtotav5.2.f and AvePOT.py.
    - How to use: Prepapre input file LOCPOT. Prepare how many components in the simulation cell, total length of the simulation cell along specific direction and lattice const      ant of each component. May need to modify vtotav5.2.f for very large length scale and increase number of grids NGXM and NOUTM.
    - vtotav.5.2.f can read LOCPOT from VASP and convert it to VLINE.txt. AvePOT.py can read VLINE.txt and calculate average potential.


-> Tool 2: Mirror.py.
   - How to use: Prepare the input file of POSCAR or CONTCAR. Should modify the vlaue of the mirror plane.
   - Mirro.py can read the structure of without mirror symmetry and output the mirror symmetry structure.


-> Tool 3: AtomDOS.py
   - How to use: Prepare the input file DOSCAR. Should type in how many atoms in the simulation cell.
   - AtomDOS.py read the DOSCAR and output DOS for each atom in file "##.txt", where ## is the number index of the atom.


-> Tool 4: Rearrange.py
   - How to use: Prepare input file PSOCAR or CONTCAR. Should modify LayerNum, Layerdist, Inipos and distance tolerance range in the source code.
   - This code can rearrange the format of POSCAR or CONTCAR plane by plane, meaning that z direction coordinates is aligned from min to max or max to min. This code is useful      to deal with complex heterostructure.


-> Tool 5: Shift.py
   - How to use: Prepare input file POSCAR or CONTCAR in Cartesian coor with just coor info without head. Modify the shift length in the code.
   - This code can shift the whole coor with a specific length. It is useful in build complex heterostructure.


-> Tool 6: DirecttoCar.py
   - How to use: Prepare POSCAR or CONTCAR without head. Modify x y z simulation size in the code.
   - Convert direct coor system to Cartesian.


-> Tool 7: Bandstructure.py
   - How to use: need work.
