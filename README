This repositry is used to store the useful programs which are written to analyse the VASP results.

-> Tool 1: vtotav5.2.f and AvePOT.py.
    - How to use: Prepapre input file LOCPOT. Prepare how many components in the simulation cell, total length of the simulation cell along specific direction and lattice constant of each component. 
        vtotav.5.2.f can read LOCPOT from VASP and convert it to VLINE.txt. AvePOT.py can read VLINE.txt and calculate average potential.
